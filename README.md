### SCOPE IMPLEMENTED: 
1. Blockchain Technology Implementation: The project will involve designing and implementing a blockchain-based solution tailored to enhance transparency and traceability within global supply chains. Blockchain's immutable ledger can provide a transparent record of transactions and product movements, enabling stakeholders to track the journey of goods from source to destination.

2. Traceability Enhancement: Utilizing blockchain technology, the project aims to improve traceability throughout the supply chain by recording every transaction, movement, and transformation of goods in a secure and transparent manner. This will enable stakeholders to easily trace the origin of products, identify potential bottlenecks or points of compromise, and swiftly address any issues related to counterfeit goods or unethical practices.

3. Data Integrity and Security: Ensuring the integrity and security of data recorded on the blockchain is crucial for building trust among stakeholders. The project will focus on implementing robust encryption mechanisms, access controls, and consensus algorithms to safeguard the integrity of supply chain data and prevent unauthorized tampering or manipulation.

4. Environmental Impact Tracking: In addition to traceability, the project will explore ways to leverage blockchain technology for tracking and monitoring the environmental impact of supply chain activities. This includes recording data related to resource consumption, emissions, waste generation, and other environmental indicators to provide stakeholders with insights into the sustainability of production processes.

5. Consumer Empowerment: The project will prioritize transparency and consumer empowerment by developing user-friendly interfaces or mobile applications that allow consumers to access real-time information about the products they purchase. This includes details about the product's origin, manufacturing process, ethical sourcing practices, and environmental footprint, enabling consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions aligned with their values.


6. Collaboration with Stakeholders: Collaboration with various stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, regulators, and consumers, is essential for the success of the project. The project will involve engaging stakeholders throughout the supply chain to ensure buy-in, address concerns, and foster collaboration in implementing blockchain-based solutions.

7. Evaluation and Continuous Improvement: Continuous evaluation and improvement are integral to the success of any blockchain project. The project will establish metrics and KPIs to measure the effectiveness of the blockchain solution in enhancing supply chain transparency, reducing unethical practices, and improving consumer trust. Based on feedback and insights gathered, iterative improvements will be made to optimize the system's performance and address emerging challenges.

By focusing on these key areas within the scope of the project, the aim is to develop a comprehensive blockchain-based solution that addresses the opacity of global supply chains, enhances traceability, promotes ethical practices, and restores consumer trust in product authenticity and ethical sourcing.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
1) DASHBOARD:
        ◦ Owners has the access to assign the blocks(unique IDs) of the blockchain initially so that we can prevent counterfeiting of products from other sources
        ◦ Acts as a source for entry of the data of journey of the product at various points of supply chain
        ◦ Acts as a source for the consumers to look through the journey of the product
        ◦ Owner get the eagle eye view of the motion of the products starting from raw material supply till the product reaches the customers

2) MOBILE APPLICATION:
    • QR code scanners are strategically deployed at different junctures along the supply chain to facilitate seamless updating of details to the blockchain data store.

    • These scanners leverage GPS functionality during scanning operations, ensuring precise location data retrieval, thereby enhancing the accuracy of information associated with the supply chain journey.

    • Serving as a reliable source of information, the system instills trust among consumers by granting them access to the complete journey of the product, empowering them with transparency and visibility into its origin and movement.


3) TRAZ IOT MODULE:
        ◦ IoT modules are employed to collect diverse data points throughout the supply chain journey, furnishing valuable insights into product quality.
        ◦ GPS sensors, either integrated as standalone units or accessed through mobile features, serve to update location information crucial for preventing the counterfeiting of goods within the supply chain.
        ◦ A dashboard interface offers comprehensive statistics derived from data gathered by the sensors, providing users with a clear overview of various metrics.
        ◦ Data captured by IoT devices is seamlessly transmitted and stored in real-time databases, leveraging the WiFi capabilities of ESP32 microcontrollers.
